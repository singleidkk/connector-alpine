Connector Setup Instructions

On each host where you will run connector:

1. Edit config.yaml to include the provided API key.
2. Run the appropriate setup script based on your system:
   - For systemd-based systems, run: ./setup-connector.sh
   - For Alpine Linux, run: ./setup-connector-alpine.sh

Before running the Alpine Linux setup script, ensure that both bash and sudo are installed. Note that sudo is available in the community repository. Verify that the community repository is enabled by checking the file /etc/apk/repositories. To install these packages, run:

  apk add bash sudo

What the Setup Scripts Do

For systemd-based systems (setup-connector.sh):
1. Copies config.yaml and the connector binary to /opt/banyan/.
2. Creates a systemd service named "connector".
3. Starts the systemd service, which launches the connector binary.

For Alpine Linux (setup-connector-alpine.sh):
1. Copies config.yaml and the connector binary to /opt/banyan/.
2. Creates an OpenRC service script (installed as /etc/init.d/connector).
3. Starts the OpenRC service, which launches the connector binary.

Logging

In both cases, the connector binary is started by the service and logs to /var/log/banyan/connector.log. Log rotation is handled automatically.
