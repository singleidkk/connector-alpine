Connector Setup Instructions

On each host where you will run connector:

1. Edit config.yaml to include the provided API key.
2. Run the appropriate setup script based on your system:
   - For systemd-based systems, run: ./setup-connector.sh
   - For Alpine Linux, run: ./setup-connector-alpine.sh

What the Setup Scripts Do

For systemd-based systems (setup-connector.sh):
1. Copies config.yaml and the connector binary to /opt/banyan/.
2. Creates a systemd service named "connector".
3. Starts the systemd service, which launches the connector binary.

For Alpine Linux (setup-connector-alpine.sh):
1. Copies config.yaml and the connector binary to /opt/banyan/.
2. Creates an OpenRC service script (installed as /etc/init.d/connector).
3. Starts the OpenRC service, which launches the connector binary.

Logging

In both cases, the connector binary is started by the service and logs to /var/log/banyan/connector.log. Log rotation is handled automatically.
